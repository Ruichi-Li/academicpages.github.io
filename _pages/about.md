            Wolvesville is an immersive multiplayer online game that transports players to the mysterious village of
            Wolvesville. Strategy, deception, and teamwork are essential as players assume the roles of both villagers
            and werewolves. Villagers must collaborate to identify and eliminate the werewolves, who, in turn, must
            cleverly conceal their identities and eliminate villagers without being discovered.

        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> Choose one player to protect every night. That player cannot be killed that night.</p>
        <p><strong>Night watchman:</strong> Thrice per game you can select a player to protect from harm at night. The protection will be consumed even if they aren't attacked. Additionally you will see which players are being protected at night by other players.</p>
        <p><strong>Butcher:</strong> You have 6 pieces of meat that you can give to another player at night to protect them from an attack. Meat given to another player is consumed regardless if it blocked an attack or not. You can protect multiple players in one night.</p>
        <p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> You can choose one player to protect every night. That player cannot be killed that night and instead you will be attacked. Because you are so strong you will survive the first attack, but you will die on the second attack. Every night you automatically protect yourself.</p>
        <p><strong>Tough guy:</strong> You can choose one player to protect every night. If you or that player is attacked, neither dies and instead you and the attacker will both see each others' roles. Because of your injuries, you will die at the end of the following day.</p>
        <p><strong>Flagger:</strong> During the night, select a player that will be protected from an attack and another that will be attacked instead. You can redirect up to two attacks this way. After a successful redirect, you cannot redirect another attack the following night.</p>
        <p><strong>Gunner:</strong> You have two bullets which you can use to kill somebody. Only one bullet can be fired per day. The shots are very loud so that your role will be revealed after the first shot. You cannot shoot during the discussion phase on the first day.</p>
        <p><strong>Bully:</strong> During the day, you can throw a rock at another player, giving them a concussion and blocking them for the current and next phase. Throwing a rock at a player previously concussed will kill them as well as reveal your role to the village. You can kill two players per game.</p>
        <p><strong>Judge:</strong> You can select a player to convict them. If votes were cast during the day vote but no player was lynched, this player will be executed instead. If this player is a villager, you will die instead. You can convict two times per game.</p>

Villagers can use the weapon to kill the other player, but the weapon will backfire if the other player is also a villager.</p>
